Case study title: We partnered with Y&R to rethink their approach to engaging with
  risky young drivers for the UK Dept. for Transport Think! Campaign.
Question: What role do cars and driving play in young people's lives, and how can
  we help them take fewer risks in the car?

    Young drivers had become immune to typical shock messaging and it was time to approach this audience with a new story. We showed the Y&R team that driving is best understood as a social practice, to understand the importance of peer influence, personal identity and what cars mean to young people.

    Our behavioural design rethink has reshaped Think!, and our social practice conceptual framework has become central to how DfT now communicate with young drivers.
