Case study title: 'In partnership with creative collective Glimpse, we used our behavioural
  design process to explore consumer attitudes and behaviours around sustainability,
  informing campaign strategies to promote reusable coffee cup use. '
Question: How do we get more British people to adopt reusable coffee cups, and save
  150 million single-use coffee cups from landfill?
Blocks:
- Article text: "Employing ethnographic immersion, user diaries, industry interviews,
    cultural and social media analysis, we unpacked contemporary sustainability trends
    and attitudes. Through our behavioural design process we identified narratives
    and intervention sites to help change behaviours and reinforce reusable cup usage
    across Britain. \n\nWe hung out at the London Coffee Festival (and hundreds of
    coffee shops across Britain) to interview reusable cup makers and coffee companies
    about the market and consumer behaviours, and made a short film about what we
    found to bring the debate to life.\n\nUsing our 10 Behavioural Levers and user
    personas derived from from our research, we workshopped a design strategy and
    developed creative briefs for Hubbub and Glimpse in their campaign development.\n\n"
