Case study title: 'Powering the comms strategy with human stories for Unilever and
  Department for International Development '
Question: How can public-private partnerships deliver against the Sustainable Development
  Goals and support social enterprises in the global South?
Blocks:
- Article text: "**Ethnographic immersion, photography, stakeholder interviews and
    communications strategy**\n\nWe partnered with MLS to develop a communications
    strategy aimed at inspiring engagement from donors and social entrepreneurs for
    Unilever and DFIDâ€™s TRANSFORM programme.\n\nThrough ethnographic immersion, multi-stakeholder
    interviews, documentary photography and systems-mapping work, we uncovered the
    human stories and real social impact that TRANSFORM social enterprises were making.
    We also brought to life the benefit that entrepreneurs gained from partnering
    with Unilever's experts teams on the ground. \n\nWe worked with MLS to populate
    a multi-channel comms plan with rich documentary content, to position TRANSFORM
    as a leading example of a public private partnership, inspiring and equipping
    other partners to replicate and invest in the model.\n\n\n\n"
