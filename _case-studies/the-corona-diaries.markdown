  Article text: "In the first week of widespread global lockdown we decided to create
    a documentary series exploring the social impact of COVID-19 on Britain.\n\nThe
    resulting series, **The Corona Diaries**, was chosen for inclusion in the BFI’s
    **Britain in Lockdown** series of the best online videos made during the pandemic.
    \n\nIn The Corona Diaries we brought to life a diverse range of experiences, giving
    voice to people in different situations to tell their stories. In making the series
    we have seen marked shifts in attitudes, behaviours, values and priorities, and
    we anticipate this will continue as people adjust to their changing social realities.
    \n\nYou can watch the full series on our [YouTube](https://youtube.com/playlist?list=PLvTKdJyFRPeSalrCINXQea1awgi1bZON5),
    or just hit play below for the first episode (the last episode is our absolute
    favourite)."

  Testimonial: '"A thoughtful series put together by creative strategy company The
    Good Side, its broader age demographic facilitating adult subjects including local
    businesses, financial hardships and the government’s handling of the crisis."
