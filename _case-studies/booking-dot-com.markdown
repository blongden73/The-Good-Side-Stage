Case study title: Understanding the LGBTQ+ travel experience.
Question: How might we help LGBTQ+ travelers make travel plans in a safe and welcoming
  way?
Blocks:
- Article text: "Booking.com wanted to better serve the LGBTQ+ community as part of
    their mission to ‘make life easier for everyone to experience the world’. \n\nWe
    helped Booking.com identify the barriers and opportunities to subtly improve travel
    for the LGBTQ+ community, starting with the online customer journey and progressing
    to consider the entire travel experience, from checkin to arrival home. \n\nInspired
    by LGBTQ+ traveler's holiday photos and anecdotes, explored further qualitative
    focus groups in the UK, Germany, and Netherlands, and later validated in a quantitative
    study, we were proud to be part of shaping a more inclusive travel experience
    for LGBTQ+ people."
  Testimonial: |-
    “'The research conducted by The Good Side has placed a crucial role in guiding Booking.com's strategy and communication to better support the LGBTQ+ travel community and put our company mission into practise in a real and practical way. They approached the project with sensitivity towards the audience and a real understanding of our business needs. Our final report was not only actionable but genuinely impactful in the mind's of my stakeholders - months later I still have them quoting back lines to me. Thank you to the team for your highly valued contribution to this important workstream"
