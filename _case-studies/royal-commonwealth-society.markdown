    **Six campaign films and  strategic communications advice**

    We wanted to create a groundswell of youth noise to impact global leaders attending CHOGM 2020, and highlight the need to urgently reform discriminatory colonial era laws.

    We created six short campaign films in collaboration with 12 young activists from across the Commonwealth, to share their stories and amplify their voices to the growing movement for change.

    Our aim was to emotionally connect global youth audiences to the campaign through individual stories and beautiful imagery that celebrated and amplified these incredible activists - young people determined to create change for the next generation across the Commonwealth.
