    <h6>The Question</h6>
    <h2>How can we encourage the Early Child Education and Development community to think about the caregiver as much as the child in investment and programme strategies?</h2>
    <h6>The Work</h6>
    <p>A month-long ethnographic immersion and documentary film production, guided by a literature review and expert interviews and backed up with a quantitative survey. We workshopped insights and conclusions with The Kays Foundation, the Keynan government and NGO stakeholders to ensure outputs were owned and co-created with people who could act on them. An interactive report to accompany the documentary film helped bring all of the thinking together, and live on beyond the project.</p>
    <h6>The Impact</h6>
    <p>Through a series of stakeholder sessions and workshops we secured commitments from key ECD donors to revise their funding strategies to focus on designing for caregiverâ€™s needs - representing over $10m in investment, mainly for mothers. Our film has become a key training tool for ECD programme design workshops, and is used as a case study for the Dignified Storytelling Alliance.</p>
